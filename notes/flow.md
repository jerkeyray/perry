Chess Engine Implementation Roadmap
1. Understand the Basics

    Chess rules overview (moves, piece behavior, special moves)

    Chess notation (FEN for position, algebraic for moves)

2. Board Representation

    Choose a board representation model (0x88, bitboards, array-based)

    Implement data structures to represent the board and pieces

    Write functions to initialize the board state from FEN strings

3. Move Generation

    Implement pseudo-legal move generation for each piece type

    Handle special move cases: en passant, castling, pawn promotion

    Implement move validation to ensure legal moves only

    Write tests verifying move generation correctness (Perft testing)

4. Game State Management

    Track turns, castling rights, en passant targets, half-move clock, full-move number

    Detect game end conditions: checkmate, stalemate, draw by repetition or 50-move rule

5. Evaluation Function

    Implement material evaluation (assign values to pieces)

    Add positional heuristics: piece activity, king safety, pawn structure

    Implement evaluation improvements incrementally

6. Basic Search Algorithms

    Implement the minimax search algorithm for decision making

    Add alpha-beta pruning to optimize search

    Implement move ordering to improve pruning efficiency

    Add iterative deepening for better move quality in limited time

7. Advanced Search Enhancements

    Implement quiescence search to avoid horizon effect

    Add transposition table caching for repeated board states

    Implement null-move pruning for faster pruning

8. Move Execution and Undo

    Implement functions to make and undo moves efficiently

    Maintain history stack for undoing moves during search

9. Input/Output Interface

    Implement a text-based interface or simple CLI to play against the engine

    Optional: Implement UCI (Universal Chess Interface) protocol to connect with chess GUIs

10. Testing and Debugging

    Write unit tests for all modules (board, moves, evaluation, search)

    Use Perft tests to verify move generation correctness to deep search depths

    Profile and debug performance bottlenecks

11. Performance Optimization

    Optimize data structures and algorithms (use bitboards if applicable)

    Optimize move ordering heuristics and pruning techniques

    Use concurrency (Go routines) carefully if appropriate

12. User Features (Optional)

    Add opening book support for better openings

    Implement endgame tablebases or simplified evaluation for endgames

    Add multi-threading support to accelerate search

    Implement time management techniques for move timing

13. GUI and Integration (Optional)

    Build or integrate a GUI frontend to play visually against your engine

    Create network interfaces or web-server APIs to play remotely
